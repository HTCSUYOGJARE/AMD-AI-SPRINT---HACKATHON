      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': 'A is the son of B, who is the daughter of C. S is the son of T, who is the daughter of U. Since A and S are from different family lines with no direct parent-child relationship, A is the cousin of S.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'D', 'reasoning': \"Assume D is a truth-teller. Then A is a truth-teller (as D says 'A is a truth-teller'). Now A says 'B is a liar' and B says 'C is a truth-teller'. If A is truthful, B is a liar, making B's statement false, so C is a liar. This gives us two truth-tellers (A and D) and two liars (B and C), satisfying the condition. Thus, A and D are the truth-tellers.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': 'If P is a truth-teller, then Q is a liar. If Q is a liar, then R is not a truth-teller. If R is a liar, then P is not a liar, which contradicts P being a truth-teller. If P is a liar, then Q is a truth-teller. If Q is a truth-teller, then R is a truth-teller. If R is a truth-teller, then P is a liar, which is consistent. Thus, Q and R are truth-tellers, making the answer B (1 truth-teller).'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'D', 'reasoning': \"If A and D are truth-tellers, then A's statement that B is a liar is true, making B a liar. D's statement that A is a truth-teller is true. B's statement that C is a truth-teller would be false, making C a liar. C's statement that D is a liar is false, confirming D is a truth-teller. This satisfies the condition of exactly two truth-tellers (A and D).\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"If Q is the truth-teller, then R is a truth-teller (as per Q's statement), which contradicts the condition of exactly one truth-teller. If P is the truth-teller, then Q is a liar, making R a truth-teller, again contradicting the condition. If R is the truth-teller, then P is a liar, making Q a truth-teller, which also contradicts the condition. Thus, the only consistent scenario is if none are truth-tellers, making D the correct answer.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': \"A is the paternal uncle of K, meaning A is the brother of K's parent. Since D is the son of E and F, and G is their child, A must be the brother of E or F. M is the maternal aunt of L, so M is the sister of L's parent. H is the daughter of I and J, who are parents of K. Since G is the child of E and F, and H is the child of I and J, G and H are cousins.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'D', 'reasoning': 'E is adjacent to A and faces the center. Since A is directly opposite B, B is across from A. E is adjacent to A, so E is next to A. F is adjacent to D and faces outward. C is two seats to the left of D. The only person who can be between E and A is D, as the seating arrangement fits the given conditions.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': 'From the clues, B is directly opposite C, and A is second to the left of B. Since the table is circular, the person opposite A would be C. D is adjacent to E, and E is between D and F, so D and F are on either side of E. F is two seats to the right of G, and G is not adjacent to A. This configuration confirms C is opposite A.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': \"Lata is the daughter of Ramesh's only sister, making her Ramesh's niece. Since Ravi is Ramesh's son, Lata is Ravi's cousin. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Cousin.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"X is the brother of Y's mother, making X the father of Y. Y is the daughter of Z, so Z is Y's father. Z is the son-in-law of W, meaning W is the mother or father of Y's spouse. U is the only daughter of T, so U is the sister of V. V is the brother of U, and V is the son of W. Therefore, X is the uncle of U.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': 'From the clues, we determine the positions step by step. B is directly opposite C, and A is second to the left of B. D is adjacent to E, who is third to the right of F. G is between H and I, with H and I facing the same direction. J is not adjacent to A or C. By analyzing the circular arrangement and eliminating contradictions, we find that E is sitting between D and F.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'D', 'reasoning': 'J is opposite K, so they are seated across from each other. Since J and K are opposite, the person sitting between them must be someone who is adjacent to both. H and I are both facing outward, and G is between H and I. Since H is facing outward, and J is opposite K, H is adjacent to J. Thus, H is between J and K.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"If R is the truth-teller, then P and Q are of the same type. If Q is a liar, then R is not a truth-teller, which contradicts. If P is a liar, then Q is a truth-teller, but that would make Q and R different types, contradicting R's statement. Thus, R must be the truth-teller, making P and Q liars.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': \"If P is a truth-teller, then Q is a liar. If Q is a liar, then R is not a truth-teller. If R is a liar, then P is not a liar, which contradicts P being a truth-teller. Thus, P must be a liar. If P is a liar, then Q is a truth-teller. If Q is a truth-teller, then R is a truth-teller. But if R is a truth-teller, then P is a liar, which is consistent. So only Q and R are truth-tellers, but this contradicts R's statement. Hence, only one truth-teller exists, Q.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"Ramesh's only sister is Lata's mother. Since Ravi's mother is Sunita, who is Ramesh's daughter, Lata is Ravi's cousin. Therefore, the correct answer is Cousin.\"}\n"
