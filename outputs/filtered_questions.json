        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ximena's statement must be true because she asserts that if Demi is a truth-teller, then Bruno is a liar. Demi's statement confirms that Ximena is a truth-teller. Bruno's statement must be false because it contradicts Ximena's truthful nature."

        "explanation": "If Fiona is a reliable person, then Dara must be a reliable person. If Dara is a reliable person, then Jira must be a liar. This is consistent. If Fiona is a liar, then Dara must be a liar, which means Jira is a truth-teller. This contradicts Fiona's claim that Dara is someone who is reliable.
